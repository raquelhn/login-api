This is a simple web application with a login screen which takes a username and password. Once authorised, it will navigate the user to another page which will display policy details.

Developed using react and semantic UI.

1. For this task, I assume that I did not have to developed anything in the backend and that I just needed to bring the policy data once I get the token from the policy API. 
I also look into bybits documentation to understand better how to make the api request

2. It took me around three hours, because it was the first time I used a token from an api to validate the user authentication, before I only worked with firechat. Moreover I had so minor issues with the deployment.

3. If I had more time I will have liked to look more into testing and the privacy on how to send the user data, which in case it didn't really matter consider the user and password was only dummy data.
